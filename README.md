# Brain-Tumour-Classification
### Overview
This project focuses on the classification of brain tumor MRI images using transfer learning. I explored three different pre-trained models: InceptionV3, ResNet50, and Xception. Among these, the Xception model emerged as the most promising, delivering the highest validation accuracy and lowest loss during training.
